# Machine Learning - Kaggle Course

## Intro to Machine Learning

1. How Models Work

   The first step if you're new to machine learning.

2. [Basic Data Exploration](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/02-explore-your-data.ipynb)

   Load and understand your data.

3. [Your First Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/03-your-first-machine-learning-model.ipynb)

   Building your first model. 

4. [Model Validation](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/04-model-validation.ipynb)

   Measure the performance of your model, so you can test and compare alternatives.

5. [Underfitting and Overfitting](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/05-underfitting-and-overfitting.ipynb)

   Fine-tune your model for better performance.

6. [Random Forests](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/06-random-forests.ipynb)

   Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.

7. [Exercise: Machine Learning Competitions](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/07-machine-learning-competitions.ipynb)

   Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress.
   
## Intermediate Machine Learning

1. [Introduction](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/01-introduction.ipynb)

   Review what you need for this Course.

2. [Missing Values](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/02-missing-values.ipynb)

   Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.

3. [Categorical Variables](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/03-variables.ipynb)

   There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning. 

4. [Pipelines](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/04-pipelines.ipynb)

   A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing.

5. [Cross-Validation](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/05-cross-validation.ipynb)

   A better way to test your models.

6. [XGBoost](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/06-xgboost.ipynb)

   The most accurate modeling technique for structured data.

7. [Data Leakage](https://github.com/SantiagoCuello97/Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Course/blob/main/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/07-data-leakage.ipynb)

   Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways.
